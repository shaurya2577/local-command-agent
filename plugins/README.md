drop ur custom scripts here and lca will learn em

## format

- `.sh` for mac/linux
- `.bat` for windows
- `.py` for python scripts

## examples

check out the existing ones

scripts get env vars passed in like `LCA_ACTION`, `LCA_PLAYLIST` etc based on the parsed intent

## safety

dont add anything destructive. system blocks stuff like rm -rf but still be careful lol
